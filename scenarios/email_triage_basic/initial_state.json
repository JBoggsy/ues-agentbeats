Our analytics team is increasingly reliant on pulling data from Meridian's dashboards, and the current manual process is becoming a bottleneck.\n\nWe need the ability to export dashboard views as CSV and PDF. Can you provide a timeline for when this might be available?

            "body_text": "Jordan, team,\n\nI've been looking into this for the past hour. Here's what I've found so far:\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- P99 latency on /v2/accounts: 4.2s → now at 3.8s (slight improvement)\n- P99 latency on /v2/transactions: 5.1s → still climbing\n- Error rate: 2.3% (up from baseline 0.1%)\n- CPU utilization on db-primary-01: 94%\n\n**Initial findings:**\nThe slow queries seem to correlate with a spike in connection pool exhaustion on the primary database. I pulled the slow query log and there's a recurring full table scan on the transactions table:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM transactions WHERE account_id IN (...) \n  AND created_at > '2026-01-27' ORDER BY created_at DESC;\nDuration: 3847ms | Rows examined: 2,847,291\n```\n\nThis looks like it might be related to the batch job that was deployed yesterday (v2.14.3). The query plan changed after the index was dropped in migration 20260127_cleanup.\n\nI'm going to check the migration history and see if we can recreate the index as a hotfix.\n\nWill update in 30 minutes.\n\n— Priya",

We'd love to have you!\n\nBest regards,\nDevConf 2026 Program Committee\nspeakers@devconf2026.org",

Karen Mitchell has been reaching out about the dashboard export feature, and I'm not sure what to tell her.\n\nTheir contract renewal is coming up in Q2, and this feature has apparently become a sticking point. Karen mentioned their CEO is involved now, which escalates the urgency on our side too.\n\nCan you give me a realistic assessment of when the dashboard export (CSV + PDF) could be ready? Even a rough estimate would help me manage expectations on their end.\n\nI don't want to promise something we can't deliver, but I also don't want to lose a $450K/year client.\n\nThanks,\nDavid",

Here's the summary:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nMigration 20260127_cleanup in v2.14.3 dropped the composite index `idx_transactions_account_date` on transactions(account_id, created_at). The batch reconciliation job that runs nightly at 03:00 UTC triggers a massive sequential scan without this index.\n\n**Fix:**\nI've prepared a hotfix that recreates the index using CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY (no downtime). PR is up: https://github.com/meridian/core-lib/pull/4530\n\n**Current status:**\n- Latency is recovering: P99 down to 1.8s (from 5.1s peak)\n- The batch job completed at 09:45, so load is dropping naturally\n- Hotfix will prevent recurrence tomorrow night\n\n**Impact assessment:**\n- Duration: ~6 hours (03:30–09:45 UTC)\n- Affected endpoints: /v2/accounts, /v2/transactions\n- Error rate peaked at 2.3%\n- Estimated affected requests: ~12,000\n\nI recommend we deploy the hotfix today and add the index to our protected migrations list to prevent accidental drops.\n\n— Priya",

She mentioned they're already looking at competitor platforms as backup.\n\nI really need you to respond to her today — even a rough estimate would help.

If anything goes wrong, we can drop the index with zero impact.\n\n**Verification:**\nI'll run the same query that caused this morning's incident and verify it uses the index scan instead of a sequential scan.\n\nPlease review and approve. I'd like Alex or Marcus to be on-call during the deployment window.\n\n— Priya",
