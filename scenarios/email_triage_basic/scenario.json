  "description": "A senior software engineer (Alex Thompson) asks their AI assistant to triage and summarize their inbox every hour throughout a full simulated workday. The assistant must read all unread emails, filter out noise (spam, newsletters, notifications), sort the remaining messages by urgency, and deliver an executive summary as a chat message each hour. The scenario runs from 06:00 to 18:00 UTC (12 hours) with 49 total emails (7 pre-existing + 42 arriving), three multi-email threads, and a realistic mix of noise and substantive correspondence.",

In each summary, ignore unimportant messages like spam, large mailing lists, newsletters, and automated notifications (calendar reminders, GitHub alerts, etc.). For the remaining messages, sort them by urgency (most urgent first) and give me a brief executive summary of each one \u2014 who it's from, what it's about, and why it matters. If there are no important new emails in a given hour, just let me know it was a quiet hour.",
